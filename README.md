# Environmental Monitoring for Climate Resilience

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of overloaded subprograms in Python to develop a tool for monitoring environmental parameters that contribute to climate resilience. The tool monitors three key variables: temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. It provides warnings when these parameters fall outside of acceptable ranges.

## Objectives

- To create a command-line tool that can assess environmental conditions.
- To utilize overloaded subprograms for flexible monitoring of different parameters.

## Features

- Monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- Provides warnings for high temperature, low humidity, and low soil moisture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Instructions for Running the Code

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   If you haven't installed Jupyter Notebook yet, you can do so using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
